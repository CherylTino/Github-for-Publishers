Let's start at the very beginning:

[Create a GitHub Account](https://github.com/)

Download a GitHub Client:

[Git for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) 
[Git for Windows](https://msysgit.github.io/)
[Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Login to your GitHub Client with your GitHub Account. Remember, if using your personal gmail account, github will use your gmail avatar for your account.
