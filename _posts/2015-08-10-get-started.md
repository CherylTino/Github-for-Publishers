##Let's start at the very beginning:

[Create a GitHub Account](https://github.com/)

##Download a GitHub Client:

[Git for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) 

[Git for Windows](https://msysgit.github.io/)

[Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Login to your GitHub Client with your GitHub Account. Remember, if using your personal gmail account, github will use your gmail avatar for your account. 

###Creating your first repo
In your GitHub client, try creating a repository by clicking on the grey **+** in the upper left-hand corner. A dialog box will open, asking you (1) what to name your new repository, and (2) where to put the repo folder. It defaults to your desktop, but you can choose to put the folder in a department server, or other place that is easy for you to access.
